The plant currently grows at a constant rate, as long as it is not thirsty. This seems to make sense,
and we have done it this way because without chlorophyl logic we cannot properly assess how the plant recieves its 
directives to allocate its terrestrial growth.

The main root will spread to include 5 children roots, which will grow at an inverted reciprical function where 
x-axis is the growth, factored by the amount of children it has spawned. This may in fact be existentially accurate..
 The child roots will grow at a factor determinate of their age, as they do not have the directive to grow children. 
 It is a similar inverted reciprical function, where growth _should_ slow over time.

_Tree will stop growing at the same rate as the roots, therefore they must contain the same age value as an overall 
factor towards their maturity level._
