FACETS: The different parts that will make up what we call a "plant"


ENERGY PULL: for now is a constant but later on will be a factor of height so we can determine the proper dispersion 
of water.

ENTROPY:
 PLANT class will call entropy functions in all of its parts. Each facet will

ROOTS:

BRANCHES:
 Branches have the ability to grow leaves, which is the basic method of trees for harnessing sunlight.
 Branches naturally grow leaves as a factor of the water assigned to them. 
 __If a tree is assigning more water to each 
 branch, the branch may decide it can grow more leaves.__

R1:
 we model the growth factor by the age of the plant, understanding if it is a young plant it will grow exponentially
 faster than an adult plant. This factor is *loosely* modelled at 5:1. We will likely have to develop a third, 
 'mature' age which will show even slower root growth.
